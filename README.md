# PS4-Cheater
PS4 Cheater is a C# based Cheating Program for the PS4 System. It's similar to Cheat Engine, in the sense that it is used to Create Cheats for PS4 Games.
The PS4 Cheater uses the [libdebug](https://github.com/a0zhar/libdebug) library, and the [ps4debug](https://github.com/a0zhar/ps4debug) ps4 payload.

## What can it do?
For in-game values such as for example: Ammo, Health, Stamina, Money, etc. it can do stuff such as: 
- Find the Offset's of and/or Pointer's for in-game values.
- Modify the value's for said in-game values in realtime.
- Create cheat tables (similar to cheat engine)
